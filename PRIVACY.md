## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Angela Lansbury 9000 bot (hereby referred to as "Bot") for Discord that was created by Caleb Dinsmore (hereby referred to as "Developer") as a free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information We Collect

While the Bot requires access to Discord message contents for some of its features, it does not store any information pertaining to user messages outside of Discord's generated IDs.

The only personal information collected by the bot is supplied by users via the birthday feature module. That information is stored securely and will never be shared with third parties for any reason whatsoever.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you may contact the Developer by email at smoredeveloper@gmail.com.
